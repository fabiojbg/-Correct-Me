# Correct Me!
**Correct Me!** is a simple Windows application that helps users use AI to correct their written texts in any language. Just put your text in and press CORRECT, and your text will be corrected with detailed explanations of all the corrections made. The AI will automatically detect the language you put it in. This tool allows you to choose which GPT to use. The supported GPTs are OpenAI, DeepSeek V3, and GPTs with an API compatible with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

On the right, you can see the corrections and explanations generated by the AI in real-time. At the end, the corrections will be shown in the bottom field with the corrections highlighted for better comprehension of the corrections made.

**IMPORTANT!** In order for this app to be able to use GPTs, you must enter the GPT API key with sufficient credits to make requests to its APIs. Refer to the GPT help pages to find information on how to generate your API keys.

You can also use this app to translate texts as well. Input your text and choose the language to translate to from the upper right language list.
